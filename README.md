## Possible Issues
Half of the time its usually the scripting utility at fault, please make sure the utility meets certain quality standards such as.
1. Supporting file functions & the debug library.
2. Not implementing lua generated / half baked versions of such functions resulting in unintended behavior.
3. Maintaing the same behavior across all usages of said functions.
### User Issues
If its not the supposed utility at fault, please try some troubleshooting steps.
1. Making sure you have connection to [the main loadstring.]([[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ravenhubfr/ravenhub/refs/heads/main/ravenhub.lua]
2. Ensuring no external script is conflicting with ravenhub.
